# Coffee Shop Data Analysis

## Prompt
Sample-HIVE-Project This project is mainly for learning and practicing simple HIVE commands in real time scenarios. Here we have taken some sample coffee shop data and processed some essential queries to demonstrate HDFS & HIVE commands. Using Spark and Scala With Coffee shop data.

## Technologies Used
- IntelliJ IDE
- Scala Programming Language (scala 2.13.8)
- Spark lib dependencies (spark v.3.2.0)
- Spark Session which enable Hive support (hive v.2.3.9)
- Microsoft Excel for visualization

## Features
List of features and TODOs for future development:
- Program reads in data from multiple CSV files and stores them in Spark SQL tables
- Uses appropriate queries (siz different queries) to gather information on the data from the CSV files
- Creates a menu for the user to easily choose which queries to run and which tables to see.
To-do list:
- Implement better exception handling for the menu
- Optimize the code
- Get more creative with visualization

## Getting Started
Use the git clone command in your terminal to clone this repo and be able to use it in your IDE:
```
git clone 
```

## Usage
Once you clone the repo, the main object is located in the Project1 directory in the src/main/scala path.
All of the CSV files used are located in the input directory.
Once you run the project it will boot up the menu which you can follow to see different query results.
