This project is a sample-HIVE-Project. This project is mainly for learning and practicing simple HIVE commands in real time scenarios. 
I was given data on different branches of a coffee shop that had different drinks associated with them and a numerical value representing the number
of consumers for a beverage. I had to read in the data from CSV files into Spark SQL objects in my IDE and perform queries on the data to analyze it.
